# Bubble Sort - PRELIM-LAB-WORK-1

A Python implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm that sorts data in descending order.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## How to Run

### 1. Prepare Your Dataset

Create or use the `dataset.txt` file with numbers, one per line:
```
5
2
8
1
9
3
7
```

### 2. Run the Script

```bash
python bubblesort.py
```

### 3. Output

The script will display:
- The sorted array in descending order
- The time taken to sort (in seconds)

Example output:
```
Sorted: [9, 8, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1]
Time: 0.000123 seconds
```

## Features

- Bubble Sort algorithm implementation
- Descending order sorting
- Performance timing measurement
- File input support for datasets
- Optimization: Early termination when array is sorted
